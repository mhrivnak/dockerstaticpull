The goal is for docker to be able to "pull" fron static files arranged in the
v2 API layout. This image serves said files for repository "dockerio/busybox".
There are still some problems, but you can try it yourself by:

$ docker run -d -p 8080:80 mhrivnak/staticreg

$ docker pull localhost:8080/dockerio/busybox
